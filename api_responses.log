Q: If a : b = 3 : 5 and b : c = 7 : 9, what is the ratio of a : c ?

a) 21 : 45
b) 21 : 35
c) 21 : 15
d) 105 : 145

Answer: a 


**Explanation:** 

To solve this, we need to find a common term for 'b' in both ratios. 

* **Step 1:**  Express 'b' in terms of 'a' from the first ratio:  
 b = (5/3)a

* **Step 2:** Substitute this value of 'b' into the second ratio: 
 (5/3)a : c = 7 : 9

* **Step 3:**  Solve for 'c' in terms of 'a':
 c = (9/7) * (5/3)a = (15/7)a

* **Step 4:**  Find the ratio a : c:
 a : c = a : (15/7)a = 7 : 15

Q: A recipe for cookies requires a ratio of 3 cups of flour to 2 cups of sugar. If you want to make a larger batch using 9 cups of flour, what quantity of sugar is needed to maintain the original ratio?

a) 4 cups
b) 6 cups
c) 8 cups
d) 12 cups
Answer: b 


**Explanation:**

*  **Understand the Ratio:** The ratio 3:2 means for every 3 cups of flour, you need 2 cups of sugar.

* **Scale Up:**  Since you're using 3 times the flour (9 cups instead of 3), you also need to scale up the sugar proportionally.

* **Calculate:**  Multiply the original sugar amount (2 cups) by 3: 2 cups * 3 = 6 cups.

Q: The ratio of apples to oranges in a basket is 3:5. If there are 18 apples in the basket, what is the proportion of oranges to the total number of fruits?

a) 5/8
b) 5/13
c) 8/13
d) 15/13
Answer: c 


**Explanation:**

1. **Find the total number of oranges:** Since the ratio is 3:5 and there are 18 apples, we can set up a proportion: 3/5 = 18/x. Solving for x, we get x = 30 oranges.

2. **Calculate the total number of fruits:** There are 18 apples + 30 oranges = 48 fruits.

3. **Determine the proportion of oranges:** The proportion of oranges to total fruits is 30/48, which simplifies to 5/8.

Q:  If  the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:5 and there are 18 apples, what is the ratio of oranges to the total number of fruits?

a) 5:8
b) 5:13
c) 3:8
d) 5:10 
Answer: a 


**Explanation:**

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Find the number of oranges:**  Since the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:5 and there are 18 apples,  we can set up a proportion: 3/5 = 18/x  where x is the number of oranges. Solving for x, we get x = 30 oranges.

2. **Calculate the total fruit:** There are 18 apples + 30 oranges = 48 total fruits.

3. **Establish the new ratio:** The ratio of oranges to the total fruit is 30:48.

4. **Simplify the ratio:** Both 30 and 48 are divisible by 6.  Simplifying the ratio gives us 5:8.

Q:  A bakery uses a ratio of 3:5 for flour to sugar in their cookie recipe. If they increase the amount of flour to 150 grams, what will be the new amount of sugar needed, maintaining the same ratio?

a) 100 grams 
b) 125 grams 
c) 250 grams 
d) 375 grams 
Answer: c 


**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the ratio:** The initial ratio is 3:5 (flour : sugar).
2. **Understand the change:** The amount of flour is increased to 150 grams.
3. **Scale the ratio:** Since the ratio needs to be maintained,  we need to figure out what multiple of the original ratio 150 grams of flour represents.  150 grams / 3 grams (original flour ratio) = 50.
4. **Calculate the new sugar amount:** Multiply the sugar part of the original ratio by 50 (the scaling factor): 5 x 50 = 250 grams.

d) (15 choose 5) - [(8 choose 5) * (7 choose 0)] 

Answer: **b)** 



**Explanation:**

This problem requires using the concept of complementary probability within Permutations and Combinations.

* **Step 1: Find the total number of ways to form the committee.**  This is a combination problem: (15 choose 5) as we have 15 people and need to choose 5.

* **Step 2: Find the number of ways to form the committee with less than 3 programmers.**  This means having 0, 1, or 2 programmers. Calculate these combinations separately:

Q:  In a group of 8 friends, 3 are to be selected to form a committee.  A subcommittee of 2 is then to be chosen from this committee.  How many different ways can this be done if the order in which the subcommittee is chosen does not matter? 

a) 56 * 3 
b) 56 * 6
c) 8 * 56
d) 8C2 * 3C2
Answer: d  

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1: Form the committee:** We need to choose 3 friends out of 8. This is a combination, denoted as 8C3 (8 choose 3).  
* **Step 2: Form the subcommittee:** We need to choose 2 friends out of the 3 on the committee. This is another combination, denoted as 3C2 (3 choose 2).

* **Total Combinations:** To get the total number of ways to form both the committee and subcommittee, we multiply the number of combinations from each step: 8C3 * 3C2.

Q: In a competition, 8 athletes are participating.  A team of 4 athletes will be selected to compete in the final round.  

How many ways can the team be formed if:

* **The team captain must be chosen from the top 3 ranked athletes**, and 
* **the remaining 3 athletes can be selected from any of the 8 athletes**?

a) 8!/(4!4!) 
b) 3P1 * 8C3 
c) 3C1 * 8P3 
d) 8C4

Answer: b 


**Explanation:**

This problem requires a combination of permutations and combinations:

* **Step 1: Choosing the captain**  We need to select 1 captain from the top 3 ranked athletes, which is a permutation (order matters). This is represented by 3P1.

* **Step 2: Choosing the rest of the team** We need to select 3 more athletes from the remaining 8, regardless of their rank. This is a combination (order doesn't matter). This is represented by 8C3. 

To get the total number of ways to form the team, we multiply the number of ways to choose the captain by the number of ways to choose the rest of the team.

Q: A committee of 5 members is to be formed from a group of 8 men and 7 women.  In how many ways can the committee be formed if it must have at least 3 women?

a)  4832  
b) 11440  
c) 8400  
d) 16384 

Answer: b 



**Explanation:**

This problem requires a combination approach with a bit of a twist. Here's how to solve it:

1. **Calculate the total possible committees:**  This is a combination problem since the order of selection doesn't matter (a committee of John, Mary, etc. is the same as Mary, John, etc.).  We use the formula:  
   _n_C_r_ = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
   Where n is the total number of people (15) and r is the size of the committee (5).
   So, 15C5 = 3003

2. **Calculate the number of committees with fewer than 3 women:**  This means we need to find the number of committees with 0, 1, or 2 women.

   * 0 women: 8C5 = 56
   * 1 woman: 8C4 * 7C1 =

Q:  In a competition, 8 athletes are to be arranged on a podium for the awarding of medals.  How many distinct arrangements are possible if:

*  The gold medal position must be filled by an athlete from a specific group of 3?

a) 10,080 
b) 12,600
c) 3360
d) 60,480

Answer:  (a) 10,080 


**Explanation:**

1. **Gold Medal:**  There are 3 choices for the gold medalist.

2. **Remaining Positions:**  There are 5 athletes left for the silver medal position, 4 for bronze, and so on. This gives us 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining athletes.

3. **Total Arrangements:** To get the total number of arrangements, multiply the possibilities for each step: 3 * 5! = 3 * 120 = 360.

Q: In a competition, 5 athletes each perform 3 different skills.  How many ways are there to arrange the order in which the athletes perform their skills, if each athlete must perform all 3 skills, and the order of skills within an athlete's performance doesn't matter? 

a) 5! * 3!
b) (5 * 3)!
c) 5! 
d) 3!

Answer: a 



**Explanation:**

* **Step 1: Athletes** There are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the 5 athletes in a line.
* **Step 2: Skills** For each athlete, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the 3 skills they perform.  

Since each athlete performs all their skills, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the athletes by the number of ways to arrange their skills.

Q: A store offers a 15% discount on a product, then applies an additional 10% discount on the already discounted price. If the original price of the product was $120, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?

a) $93.60
b) $96.00
c) $102.00
d) $108.00

Answer: a) $93.60 


**Explanation:**

1. **First Discount:** Calculate the amount of the first discount: 15% of $120 = (15/100) * $120 = $18.
2. **Price After First Discount:** Subtract the discount from the original price: $120 - $18 = $102.
3. **Second Discount:** Calculate the amount of the second discount: 10% of $102 = (10/100) * $102 = $10.20.
4. **Final Price:** Subtract the second discount from the price after the first discount: $102 - $10.20 = $91.80.

Q:  A certain store offers a 20% discount on all items, then an additional 10% discount on the discounted price. If a shirt originally costs $50, what is the final price after both discounts are applied?

a) $36 
b) $38
c) $40
d) $42
Answer: a 


**Explanation:**

* **First Discount:** 20% of $50 = $10 discount.
* **Price after first discount:** $50 - $10 = $40
* **Second Discount:** 10% of $40 = $4 discount.
* **Final Price:** $40 - $4 = $36

Q: A store offers a 30% discount on a product initially priced at $150.  After applying the discount, a customer uses a coupon for an additional 15% off the already discounted price.  What is the final price of the product?

a) $85.50
b) $97.50
c) $105.00 
d) $112.50

Answer: b) 


**Explanation:**

1. **First Discount:** 30% of $150 is (0.30) * ($150) = $45.
   Subtracting the discount, the price becomes $150 - $45 = $105.

2. **Second Discount:** 15% of $105 is (0.15) * ($105) = $15.75.
   Subtracting this second discount, the final price is $105 - $15.75 = $89.25.

Q: Sarah can complete a task in 12 hours, while John takes 18 hours to complete the same task. If they work together for 4 hours, what fraction of the task is completed?

a) 1/3
b) 2/3
c) 1/2
d) 5/9

Answer: d 


**Explanation:**

This problem requires understanding work rates and combining them. 

* **Find individual work rates:**
    * Sarah completes 1/12 of the task per hour.
    * John completes 1/18 of the task per hour.
* **Combine work rates:** Their combined rate is 1/12 + 1/18 = 5/36 of the task per hour.
* **Calculate work done in 4 hours:** Multiply the combined rate by the time: (5/36) * 4 = 5/9 of the task.

Q:  A team of 6 workers can build a wall in 12 days.  If they start building the wall and then 4 more workers join them after 3 days, how many days will it take them to complete the wall?

a) 8 days 
b) 9 days 
c) 10 days 
d) 11 days 
Answer: b 



**Explanation:**

* **Step 1:** Calculate the total work involved: 6 workers * 12 days = 72 worker-days
* **Step 2:** Calculate the work done in the first 3 days: 6 workers * 3 days = 18 worker-days
* **Step 3:**  Calculate the remaining work: 72 worker-days - 18 worker-days = 54 worker-days
* **Step 4:** Calculate the new number of workers: 6 workers + 4 workers = 10 workers
* **Step 5:** Calculate the days to complete the remaining work: 54 worker-days / 10 workers = 5.4 days. 


Since we can't have fractions of days, it will take them **9 days** to complete the wall.

Q:  A team of 3 carpenters can complete a house framing project in 12 days.  A different team of 2 carpenters takes 18 days to complete the same framing project. If both teams start working simultaneously on the project, how many days will it take them to finish?

a) 7.2 days
b) 8.4 days
c) 9.6 days
d) 10.8 days
Answer: b 


**Explanation:**

* **Step 1: Calculate the work done by each team per day.**
    * Team 1: 1/12 of the project per day.
    * Team 2: 1/18 of the project per day.

* **Step 2: Calculate the combined work done by both teams per day.**
    * Combined work = 1/12 + 1/18 = 5/36 of the project per day.

* **Step 3:  Determine the total number of days to complete the project.**
    *  Total days = 1 / (combined work per day) = 1 / (5/36) = 36/5 days = 7.2 days.

Q:  A team of 5 workers can complete a project in 12 days.  If 3 of those workers are unavailable, how many days will it take the remaining workers to complete the same project, assuming they work at the same rate?

a) 18 days
b) 20 days
c) 24 days 
d) 30 days
Answer: c 


**Explanation:**

* **Step 1: Calculate the total work.**  5 workers take 12 days, so the total work is 5 * 12 = 60 worker-days.
* **Step 2: Determine the work rate of one worker.**  If 60 worker-days represent the total work, one worker completes 60 / 5 = 12 worker-days of work.
* **Step 3:  Calculate the time for the remaining workers.** With 2 workers, they'll need 60 worker-days / 2 workers = 30 days.

Q:  A team of 6 workers can complete a project in 12 days.  If 3 of those workers are replaced with less experienced workers who take twice as long to complete the same task, how many days will it take the new team to finish the project?

a) 15 days 
b) 18 days 
c) 20 days 
d) 24 days 
Answer: b 


**Explanation:**

Here's how to solve it:

1. **Calculate total work:** 6 workers * 12 days = 72 worker-days (This represents the total amount of work needed to complete the project)

2. **Work rate of the less experienced workers:** Since they take twice as long, they complete half the work per day compared to the original workers.

3. **New team's work rate:** 
   *  3 original workers * (1/12) work per day = 1/4 work per day
   *  3 new workers * (1/24) work per day = 1/8 work per day
   *  Total new team work rate = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8 work per day

4. **Days to complete:** 72 worker-days / (3/8 work per day) = 192 days

a) 4 hours
b) 6 hours
c) 8 hours
d) 9 hours
Answer:  b) 6 hours 


**Explanation:**

* **Step 1:** Calculate the work done by one worker in one hour: 1/12 of the job.

* **Step 2:**  Calculate the combined work done by three workers in one hour: (1/12) + (1/12) + (1/12) = 3/12 = 1/4 of the job.

* **Step 3:**  Determine the time taken to complete the whole job by working at a rate of 1/4 of the job per hour: 1 / (1/4) = 4 hours.

Q:  Three workers, A, B, and C, are tasked with building a wall. Worker A can build the entire wall alone in 8 hours. Worker B takes 12 hours to build the wall alone.

a) 3 hours 
b) 4 hours 
c) 5 hours 
d) 6 hours 
Answer: b 


**Explanation:**

This problem requires understanding individual work rates and combining them for collaborative effort. Here's how to solve it:

1. **Calculate individual hourly rates:**
   - A: Completes 1/8 of the wall per hour
   - B: Completes 1/12 of the wall per hour
   - C: Completes 1/16 of the wall per hour

2. **Calculate the combined hourly rate:**
   - Add the individual rates: 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/16 = 11/48 of the wall per hour

3. **Determine the time to build 3/4 of the wall:**
   - Divide the desired portion (3/4) by the combined hourly rate: (3/4) / (11/48) = 3

Q:  A worker can finish a task alone in 12 hours.  Another worker can finish the same task alone in 18 hours. If they work together for 6 hours, then the first worker stops working, how long will it take the second worker to complete the remaining work?

a) 9 hours
b) 10 hours
c) 12 hours
d) 15 hours
Answer: b 


**Explanation:**

Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate individual work rates:**

* Worker 1 completes 1/12 of the task per hour.
* Worker 2 completes 1/18 of the task per hour.

**2. Calculate combined work rate:**

* Together, they complete (1/12) + (1/18) = 5/36 of the task per hour.

**3. Calculate work done in 6 hours:**

* In 6 hours, they complete (5/36) * 6 = 5/6 of the task.

**4. Calculate remaining work:**

* The remaining work is 1 - (5/6) = 1/6 of the task.

**5. Calculate time for the second worker to complete the remaining work:**

Q:  A, B, and C can complete a task in 6, 8, and 12 hours respectively.  They work together for 2 hours, and then C stops working. How long will it take A and B to finish the remaining work?

a) 3 hours 
b) 4 hours 
c) 5 hours  
d) 6 hours 
Answer: b 


**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate individual work rates:**
   - A completes 1/6 of the task per hour.
   - B completes 1/8 of the task per hour.
   - C completes 1/12 of the task per hour.

2. **Calculate combined work in the first 2 hours:**
   - Together, they complete (1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12) * 2 = 1/2 of the task.

3. **Calculate remaining work:**
   -  There is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 of the task left.

4. **Calculate A and B's combined work rate:**
   - A and B's combined rate is 1/6 + 1/8 = 7/24 of the task per hour.

5. **Calculate time to finish the remaining work:**

a) 3 hours
b) 4 hours
c) 5 hours
d) 6 hours
Answer:  b) 4 hours 


**Explanation:**

This problem requires a few steps:

1. **Calculate individual work rates:** A completes 1/12 of the task per hour, and B completes 1/15 of the task per hour.

2. **Combine work rates:**  Working together, they complete (1/12) + (1/15) = 17/60 of the task per hour.

3. **Determine work done together:** Let 'x' be the number of hours they worked together. In that time, they completed (17/60) * x of the task.

4. **Set up an equation:** The remaining work is 1 - (17/60) * x, and A completes this in 8 hours. So, (1 - (17/60) * x) / (1/12) = 8

5. **Solve for x:** Simplify and solve the equation to find the value of x,

a) 4 hours 
b) 6 hours 
c) 8 hours 
d) 10 hours 
**Answer:**  b) 6 hours 


**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate the work done together:** In 6 hours, they complete (6/18) + (6/12) = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6 of the task.

2. **Calculate the remaining work:** The remaining work is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6 of the task.

3. **Calculate the time Bob takes:** Since Bob takes 12 hours to complete the whole task, he'll take (1/6) * 12 = 2 hours to complete 1/6 of the task.
