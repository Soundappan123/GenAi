      "as other unforeseeable risks paralysis, numbness, incontinence, CSF leak, and risk of blindness. The patient\n",
      "verbally confirmed that there was no guarantees provided. Prognosis and recovery were discussed at length.\n",
      "The patient consented to the surgery and we proceeded with the procedure.\n",
      "PROCEDURE:\n",
      "After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room. The patient was placed under\n",
      "general anesthesia and intubation. The patient was given antibiotics and was positioned. The patient was\n",
      "positioned and the area of interest was shaved, prepped, and draped under sterile condition. We utilized a spinal\n",
      "needle and fluoroscopy to localize the correct spinal level and location of the incision. The incision was marked and\n",
      "injected with Marcaine with Epi %0.5, 5cc. SSEP and MEP were obtained at the beginning of the procedure and\n",
      "positioning.\n",
      "The incision was made using a 10 blade knife. The fascia was exposed carefully. The fascia was carefully opened\n",
      "to expose the spinous process and the lamina on the affected side. The lamina was exposed to the level of the\n",
      "pars and just shy of the facet capsule that was preserved.\n",
      "We identified the level of the spine and the side with fluoroscopy. The L5-S1 was targeted on RIGHT.\n",
      "Under microscopic magnification, laminotomy was performed of the upper level using high speed drill, kerrison, and\n",
      "curettes. The ligamentum flavum was exposed. Care was taken to keep the pars intact. Medial facetectomy was\n",
      "done using osteotomes.The ligament flavum was carefully elevated and removed. The lateral recess was.\n",
      "dissected and decompressed. The transverse process of the lower level was delineated as well as the facet joint..\n",
      "The lateral aspect of the facet joint was directed and drilled off. The attaching fascia to the facet joint and top of the\n",
      "TP was dissected and reflected.\n",
      "Laminotomy of the lower level was performed following the dura and the traversing exiting nerve root. This lower\n",
      "level laminotomy was extended inferiorly until the dura appeared to be decompressed and we were able to see the\n",
      "takeoff of the exiting nerve root.\n",
      "We followed the nerve root and performed a foraminotomy by careful dissection around the nerve and removing the\n",
      "ligaments and the bony anatomy from around the nerve. This dissection and decompression was continued until\n",
      "the nerve appeared well decompressed into the foramen.\n",
